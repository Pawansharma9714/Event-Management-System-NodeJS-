1.1 What is Node JS?:
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser.
Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.
